Introduction\nNow that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve. If you cannot think of an idea or a problem, here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea.\n2. In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it? Similarly, if a contractor is trying to start their own business, where would you recommend that they set up their office?\n\nThese are just a couple of many ideas and problems that can be solved using location data in addition to other datasets. No matter what you decide to do, make sure to provide sufficient justification of why you think what you want to do or solve is important and why would a client or a group of people be interested in your project.\nSo I decided to try to answer this simple question: where would you recommend to open a new restaurant?"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 1.1. Background and Problem\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. Although most people who have COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can also cause severe illness and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness.\n\nThe CDC and WHO has been trying to combat COVID-19 through testing, and vaccination. Testing has emerged as one of the key worldwide measures to slow and hopefully stop the spread of COVID-19. Testing leads to quick identification of cases and is critical for this pandemic as people can have the disease\u2014and spread it far and wide\u2014for two weeks before showing symptoms. Fast testing is credited with slowing the spread of the virus in places such as South Korea, and continued testing can help better allocate resources, save time and equipment in hospitals, and provide helpful data.\n\nVaccines are a critical new tool in the battle against COVID-19 and it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving successful and going into development. Vaccine effectiveness was at least 97% against symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, severe and critical hospitalizations, and deaths. Working as quickly as they can, scientists from across the world were collaborating and innovating to bring us tests, treatments and vaccines that will collectively save lives and end this pandemic.\n\nIn order to make the testing and vaccines available to people in different neighborhoods around the world, it is important they are optimally placed in high concentration areas for easy access to the general population. Since New York City has been the epicenter of the virus on the East Coast of the United States of America, we will place our focus on the neighborhoods of New York. Contractors may have a limited number of testing sites or vaccine facilities that they can use, so it is important to find the optimal locations in New York City based on population."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 1.2. Data\nWe will be collecting data from following sources:\n\nNew York City data that contains borough, neighborhoods along with their latitudes and longitudes. Neighborhood has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood.\n\nThis can be found online at https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset or https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/newyork_data.json.\n\nWe can get the population data from scarping Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_New_York_City We are going to go through each of the links of neighborhood and find the population of each of them.\n\nFor additional insights, we can fetch Hosptial information from foursquare API (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/) and NYS Health Profile website (https://profiles.health.ny.gov/)."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
